### About
There have been recreations in Python, R, Highcharts of plots in Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic ‘s book [Storytelling With Data](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/book/downloads). Here I try to reproduce them using Tableau and giving my understanding of those plots.

### Principles
I will not reproduce those charts 100% the same as the original one, eg. tracking exactly the same color, layout, fonts, etc. Instead, I will try to capture the author’s thinking and adjust them based on my ideas.
